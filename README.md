# Vizness
Vizness is my final project for my data science class, I intend to use the Quiver Quantitative API to aggregate data on the stock trades of government officials, and build out an application that allows you to visualize this data in meaningful ways.
## The team
Charles Merritt and Edward Hayashi constructed Vizness collaboratively in Spring of 2023.
## The goal
The goals of vizness are...
- To encourage investment transparency for elected officials.
- To promote economic mobility by democratizing valuable information.
