# Sherwood
Sherwood is our final project for our data science class, we intend to use the Quiver Quantitative API to aggregate data on the stock trades of government officials, and build out an application that allows you to visualize this data in meaningful ways. Our application will be unique for a few reasons: it will include important contextual data that is often lacking in similar applications (including the Quiver Quantitative mainsite), it will enable comparisons and explorations of the stock trades of all 535 members of Congress, it will allow you to subdivide Congress in interesting ways by analyzing certain committees, party affiliations, state, and more. Importantly, Sherwood will be completely free and open source, whereas similar programs are almost always locked behind paywalls. 
## The team
Charles Merritt, Edward Hayashi, and Brennin Heinel constructed Sherwood collaboratively in Spring of 2023.
## The goals
The goals of Sherwood are...
- To encourage investment transparency for elected officials.
- To promote economic mobility by democratizing valuable information.
- To expose potential conflicts of interest within our government.
## The philosophy
We believe that good humans will practice what they preach, this is even more important for politicians and other government officials who are supposed to represent their constituents at the highest levels of our government. Indeed this is the goal behind the 2012 STOCK act which required politicians and their immediate family memers to report any trades they make that are valued over $1000 within 45 days. As the Russian maxim goes, "trust, but verify." These officials have found themselves in a position of trust, we believe it is our duty to verify.
