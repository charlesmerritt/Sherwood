### Welcome!
##### This is the home page, where you can find information about the project and the team.
##### Click on the buttons above to navigate to the other pages.
##### You can explore data from the House of Representatives and the Senate.

### About the Project   
=========================
##### This project was created as a final project for Data Science I at the University of Georgia under the instruction
##### of Dr. Maria Hybinette. The project was created by: Charles Merritt, Brennin Heinel, and Edward Hayashi. 
##### The goal of this project is to create a visualization tool that allows users to explore data from the House of
##### Representatives and the Senate. The data is pulled from the ProPublica Congress API, as well as the Quiver
##### Quantitative Finance API. The rest of the project is written in Python, using the Taipy library for the GUI, and
##### core data science libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

### How to use Sherwood
=========================
##### To use Sherwood, simply click on the buttons below to navigate to the other pages. You can explore data from the
##### House of Representatives and the Senate. There you can select a state to view data for representatives from that
##### state. Once you have selected a representative, you can visualize their trades in a variety of ways. Such as
##### viewing their trades by date, or by ticker. You can also view the total value of their trades over time. You can
##### also view the total value of trades for all representatives from a given state. You can also view a pie chart
##### showing the distribution of stock purchases by industry.
